# My Portfolio

As for now, this is a work in progress. It will eventually be a cool portfolio to represent my abilities (or so I hope).

Whoever is reading this, have a good day! â™¥

PS: The portfolio is currently in English only (will have Spanish too, eventually).


## ToDo List
- Add an "About Me" section
- Show work experience
- Show soft skills* (still have to consider if it's worth)
- Add actual functionality to footer icons
- Add technologies used on each project
- Add tags on projects, such as #frontend, #backend, #api, and so on...
- Add icons for technlologies, for both My Projects and My Skills
